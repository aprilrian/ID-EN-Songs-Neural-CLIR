150,Don’t,Ed Sheeran,i met this girl late last year she said don't you worry if i disappear i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait but then i jumped right in a week later returned i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn but i gave her my time for two or three nights then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again she told me i was never looking for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around ten baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin we'll be in between the sheets till the late am baby if you wanted me then you should have just said she's singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe   and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza before a text message was the only way to reach her now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her singing out aretha all over the track like a feature and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either but me and her we make money the same way four cities two planes the same day and those shows have never been what it's about but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out when she was kissing him how i was confused about now she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe   knock knock knock on my hotel door i don't even know if she knows what for she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya trust and respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next you bastard but you didn't need to take him to bed that's all and i never saw him as a threat you bastard until you disappeared with him to have sex of course it's not like we were both on tour we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment but it was never just fun and i thought you were different this is not the way you realised what you wanted it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest and all this time god knows i'm singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over

you better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll

my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me

are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers

arms are heavy there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud he opens his mouth but the words won't come out he's choking how everybody's joking now the clock's run out time's up overblaow snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't give up that easy no he won't have it he knows his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and   you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo you better   his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping this world is mine for the taking make me king as we move toward a new world order a normal life is boring but superstardom's close to postmortem it only grows harder homie grows hotter he blows it's all over these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows he's known as the globetrotter lonely roads god only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father he goes home and barely knows his own daughter but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water these hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product they moved on to the next schmoe who flows he nosedove and sold nada and so
